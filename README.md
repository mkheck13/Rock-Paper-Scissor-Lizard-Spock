## Peer Review: Although the site is very bare bones and unfinished, I saw the vision of what you wanted it to be, the avtual logic behind the comparison between the two choices was there and looked correct, jus unfortunately, I think you just ran out of time and couldn't prperly set everything up. It was a good attempt at the project overall tho, the backgrounds and accessability for the rules and the homescreen were a nice touch, even the pictuers for the player versus player and player versus computer was cool, the site just didn't really work as a whole. I commented out a couple errors that were present which was a case of the html element with the id did not exist on any of the html files so that cased the connsole to recive a null value instead. Good try though.
